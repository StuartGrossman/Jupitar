Hello welcome!

In this app I am using a few gems to help me with my development process.

* Better_errors - Allows me to console variables to see what value they hold. It also allows me to see the full stack of operations happening inside my application.
* Quiet_assets - A gem to help me look at my rails logs inside my console with a bit more ease. It takes away all the get/post/delete response code. Leaving a more refactored list of logs making it easier for me to debug my program
* Meta_request - A nice chrome add-on that gives an extra tab the console in chrome, allowing for more information about whatâ€™s happening inside my application. Mostly information about active record data transactions
* awesome print - This gem also helps me visualize my active record content. I can call objects inside my console and see a full color structure of the object exposing its internal structure with proper indentation
* pry_rails - a very useful tool in seeing what is going wrong with certain lines of code inside my application. It allows me to run my sever, and then stop it at the particular method or line of code where I believe there to be a problem. Break down the objects and identify where the information is missing or being corrupted.
* biding_of_caller - allows you to have access to the method binding.of_caller("stack level") and go back inside a stack of methods or objects and replace values within those methods to test the output
* pry-byebug - Allows me to add step, next, finish, and continue commands to my breakpoints that I set inside my code using pry. Basically you can edit your pry breaks in almost any way.
* Bundle Install - This command takes all your gems inside your Gemfile and updates them to their current versions by pulling the information from the offical gem library
* we use Postgres instead of sqlite3 because of its compatiblity with heroku. Sqlite3 does not work with heroku.
